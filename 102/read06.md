Chapter 10 

First of all you need to imagine that that there is an invisible box around
every HTML element. Different kinds of selectors mak you able  to target your
rules at various elements. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface. Usually CSS appear in different document, but you can link it with html.

The color property enable you to specify the text color inside an element. You can choice any
color in CSS using three ways:

1- rgb values

/* rgb value */
p {
color: rgb(100,100,90);}

2- hex codes

/* hex code */
h2 {
color: #ee3e80;}

3- color names

/* color name */
h1 {
color: DarkCyan;}

You can use the color picker to help you select the color you like, but you need to make sure that there is enough 
difference in the white color and the color you select so you can see the background.
