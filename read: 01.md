The command line is a text operating system, where we can write the instructions and the output will appear directly. And it provide us with the promot so we can apply the command after the promot, also there is sell which is control how the the terminal behavior and implement the running process of the code. If you entered command before do not worry! because it will be stored by it self in the history.

 

Basic Navigation  

Most of the commands  use abbreviation of a word or other words describe the command. For example: pwd  is an abbreviation for Print Working Directory. When we use the command to refer to  file or directory, in fact we refer to something called path. A path divided to two branched a absolute and relative.

More About Files!

We can define the file as everything starting from text file and not ending with a directory . 

There are many common extensions here are some of them:

file.exe - an executable file, or program.
file.txt - a plain text file.
file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.
We need to take care when we use the spaces in the files and directory, and the space basically defines how we separate items. Moreover, in Linux there is a gentle way to specify the hidden files or directory.  To hide a file or directory you only need to use the letter a before the command.
