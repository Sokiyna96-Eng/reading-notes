We use many elements in html and the purpose of them is to define the structure of the page. for example : 

HTML has six "levels" of
headings:

<h1>Hello There!<h1>
<h2>Hello There!<h2>
<h3>Hello There!<h3>
<h4>Hello There!<h4>
<h5>Hello There!<h5>
<h6>Hello There!<h6>

It is important to use each tag only one time.

CSS is how to make your web page colorfull and attractive, you can assosiate the rules of CSS with the html, but usually we use seperate documents to CSS.

**Note :  CSS and HTML are not technically programming languages, in fact they are page structure and style information**


***JavaScript***

We use the variables in javaScript to remember the values, the variable name is alawyes used to declare the variables function. Scripts include quite accurate instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value. Also this language is able to differentiate each type of data. 

To bring the variation between days/weeks/years, you divide this number by the number of milliseconds in a day/week/year.

|Assignment                 |  x = y	              |           x = y
|Addition assignment	    |      x += y	          |               x = x + y
|Subtraction assignment     | x -= y                  |        x = x - y
|Multiplication assignment	| x *= y	              |           x = x * y
|Division assignment	    |     x /= y              |            x = x / y
|Remainder assignment	    | x %= y                  |        x = x % y
