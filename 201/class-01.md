***HTML***

The mean purpose of the html is to define the structure of the page, also it is a text-based document.
The html structure contains the following: 

1.	body

Anything you write inside the body will show the browser.

2.	head

It contains general information about the page.

3.	title

You can find this element inside the head; it is representing the title bar in the web page. 

Here an example to how the html code structure looks like:

<opening_tag> attributes< closing_tags>

**Note: some attributes do not need tags like images.**

Some character are reserved for the  HTML code, they usually called escape characters 

|       character                  |    Escape character 
|  --------------------------------| ------------------------                
|       Less-than sign             |      &lt;
|       Greater-than sign          |      &gt;
|       Ampersand                  |      &amp;
|       Quotation mark             |      &quot;
|       Cent sign                  |      &cent;

Therefore, we use them to add special character to our page. 

Now we are going to describe somthing called elements which is a great part of the page to define the structure.

This picture describe how the elements creat the structure. 

Let's talk now about the process and desgin for your page, as you notce or know the font color, type and size is really essential to take the reder attention to your content. I am going to show you that in simple example:

1. <p style="color:red; font-size:300%; font-family:verdana;"> Great Sale <p>

2. <p> Great Sale<p>

Now you see the difference and the importance of changing the desgin of the page. 


***JavaScript***

A script is a sequence of orders that a computer can follow to attain a goal line. You could compare scripts to any of the following:

RECIPES

By following the instructions in a recipe, one-by-one in the order set out, cooks can create a dish they have never made before.

HANDBOOKS

Large companies often provide handbooks for new employees that contain procedures to follow in certain situations.

What is JavaScript used for?

1.  Adding interactive behavior to web pages
2. Creating web and mobile apps
3. Game development


JavaScript allows you to device multifaceted topographies on web pages — each time a web page does more than just sit there and show static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is perhaps involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of typical web technologies.
