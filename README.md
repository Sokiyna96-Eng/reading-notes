### Mindset Definition and Types

A **mindset** refers to whether you believe qualities such as intelligence and talent are fixed or changeable traits.

There are two different types of mindset 	:brain: :

- People with a ***fixed mindset*** believe that these qualities are inborn, fixed, and unchangeable.
- Those with a ***growth mindset***, on the other hand, believe that these abilities can be developed and strengthened by way of commitment and hard work.


#### For Example:
 If you say, “I'm not a math person” then that belief acts as an easy excuse to avoid practicing maththe **fixed mindset** prevents you from failing in the short–run, but in the long–run it hinders your ability to learn, grow, and develop new skills.Meanwhile, someone with a **growth mindset** would be willing to try math problems even if they failed at first. They see failure and setbacks as an indication that they should continue developing their skills rather than a signal that indicates.
